**Simulation of Piston-crank mechanism**

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **piston-crank mechanism** using **CATIA V5**. The model replicates the motion of a basic internal combustion engine, where rotary motion of the crankshaft is converted into the linear motion of the piston.

## üõ† Features

- Modelled all components: crankshaft, connecting rod, piston, and cylinder
- Applied proper assembly constraints for realistic motion
- Simulated using **DMU Kinematics** to visualize motion and analyze stroke
- Includes:
  - Assembly file (`.CATProduct`)
  - Simulation file (`.CATProcess` or `.CATProduct` with kinematics)

## üì¶ Tools Used

- CATIA V5 (Part Design, Assembly Design, DMU Kinematics)
- Windows OS

## üîç Purpose

This simulation helps visualise how a crankshaft translates rotational motion into the linear motion of a piston. It is widely used in understanding engine mechanics and dynamic linkage systems in robotics.

## ‚úÖ Applications

- Educational demonstration
- Robotics mechanisms
- Mechanical simulation practice
